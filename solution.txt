1. haproxy is listening on the container port 80, but i can’t access it from localhost outside the container. can you fix it? (you may restart the container for this)

Solution: Run docker container with following cmd to access locally:
			docker run -d -p 80:80 --name docker-challenge mkassaian/docker-challenge:bug-fixs

2. when you send a GET request to the server, it works only 1/3 times. can you figure out why and fix it from within the container (two parts)? do not change the port numbers the nginx processes listen on or have more than 3 nginx processes running. bonus: can you do it without causing downtime on the haproxy?

Solution: 
	Update /entrypoint.sh
		/etc/nginx/nginxo2.conf -> /etc/nginx/nginx02.conf

	Update /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg:
		server localhost-01 localhost:8000 -> server localhost-01 localhost:8001

3. edit the http response to say “it works! solved by [name]”. also, create a file called /solution.txt inside your final image with a summary of how you figured out what the issues were and what commands you ran to solve them. then, save it as a new image named “docker-challenge-solved-[name]”. you should be able to run this new image and get the correct response from the api 3/3 times.	

Solution: 
	Update index.html file @/var/www/html/index.html with "it works! solved by Manish Kumar"

	File saved @/solution.txt with solution.

Note: In addition to that I used "netstat" and "ps" cmds to check wheather process are running on specific port and process are up and running respectevily.
